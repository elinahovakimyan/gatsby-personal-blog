Be careful with your morning routine and never underestimate its power. Every routine boosts your productivity as those actions gradually become habits and you spend less energy on them.

**How you start your day determines how your day will be.** Here are tips to come up with a helpful morning routine that fits you best.


## Wake up as early as possible
Decide the time yourself in the beginning but get out of your comfort zone. If youâ€™re working at an office, itâ€™s best to wake up at least 2 hours before leaving to be able to get things done. Most successful people wake up at 5 am or 6 am (some of them even 4 am ðŸ˜®).


## Get up on the same time every day
Snooze button is the biggest enemy to your productivity. Not snoozing and getting up is your first decision of every day and that decision may either motivate you or make you procrastinate further.


## Go to bed early
This is not a morning routine obviously, but if you want to have a consistent and satisfying morning routine, you should definitely get enough sleep. After some time your organism will adopt changes, but being persistent in the beginning is your responsibility. ðŸ˜‰


## Start your day with an energizer
No, no, I donâ€™t mean drinks. Iâ€™d prefer nice music and exercising. However tired you feel, turn on a music, get up and start exercising! Itâ€™s not just good for your health, but also it awakens your body and fills you with energy which accompanies you the whole day.


## Or with a motivational speech
Another alternative to music is to turn on a motivational speech to start your day motivated. There are dozens of such speeches on YouTube that you may like.


> NOTE: This is an alternative to music, Exercising is irreplaceable ðŸ˜‹


## Plan your morning tasks the previous day
This is another point that is not done in the morning, but for the morning. Clarify your morning tasks beforehand so that you know why you should get up early in the morning. But of course, it also depends on your personality as some people prefer to plan in the morning.


## Allocate time for thinking
Following the society unconsciously is a dangerous game to play. Allocate some time to analyze your goals and progress every day. Clarify what you expect from that day and start rocking it. ðŸ˜Ž
